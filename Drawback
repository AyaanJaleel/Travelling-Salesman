This algorithm has one major drawback:

1) As the number of cities grow, the chances of finding the most optimal path diminishes.

Why does this happen? Because it will take a long time to test all the paths. For example, say we have 40 cities to go to. The amount of possible paths is 40!.
That's a lot of paths to test. 

I'll try to improve the efficiency of this algorithm at a later stage.
